Note:
If the macro __STDIO_FDEVOPEN_COMPAT_12 is declared before including
<stdio.h>, a function prototype for fdevopen() will be chosen that is backwards
compatible with avr-libc version 1.2 and before. This is solely intented for providing
a simple migration path without the need to immediately change all source
code. Do not use for new code.
