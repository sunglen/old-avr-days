Another Led Game

This is another LED Game based on Takuya Matsubara's funning
http://nicotak.com/avr/ledgame.html[LED Game for AVR].
There are some differences between this LED Game and Matsubara san's
original LED Game: 

- I use four 8x8 LED dot-matrix displays to assemble a 16x16 
  dot-matrix display, because it's hard to buy a 16x16 unit
  in our local market.
- I add a dual-axis accelerometer `ADXL311` and a demo program
  to show a `rolling ball` on the display.
- Instead of the four direction keys, a navigation switch 
  (joystick switch) has been used.
- I made a little change in firmware library `led.c` to fit
  my LED display.
- I write a simple program to convert `Binary Constant` 
  (i.e. ``0b1101'') to shift mode (i.e.``((1<<3)|(1<<2)|1)''), 
  because Binary Constant seems not supported by my GCC.

Hardware
--------
I use ATMEGA88 for this project, and the schematics is simillar 
with http://nicotak.com/avr/develop/inside.html[Mr. Matsubara's]. 
I built it on two bread boards: `the lower` and `the upper`.

[NOTE]
LED dot-matrix which I bought is DX7088A/B, I create a 
link:led-dot-matrix.lbr[Eagle library] for it.

Firmware
--------
You can download http://www.callmeageek.com/filemgmt/visit.php?lid=1[another-ledgame.tar.gz], 
there are some resources in it:

*roll-ball*::
  Demo program. It's simulating a rolling ball on a 16x16 grids plane.
  To play it, first download `test.hex` to AVR. When ``ROLL BALL'' being
  displayed, press switch B (S2) to start.
*demo*::
  Demo program from http://nicotak.com/avr/ledgame.html[LED Game for AVR],
  with some changes to fit this environment.
*aruke, block and space-flight*::
  Games from http://nicotak.com/avr/ledgame.html[LED Game for AVR],
  with some changes to fit this environment.
*bin2shift.l*::
  Lex code for converting Binary Constant 
  (i.e. ``0b1101'') to shift mode (i.e.``((1<<3)|(1<<2)|1)''). 
  To use this tool,

 $lex -obin2shift.c bin2shift.l
 $gcc -o bin2shift bin2shift.c -lfl
 $mv test.c test.c.in
 $cat test.c.in | ./bin2shift >test.c

All above programs can be built under 
http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/install_tools.html[GNU Tool Chain].

[NOTE]
In order to have a nice display effect, AVR running
in 8MHz is fine.

[TIP]
This `Another LED Game` can run most games listed in
http://nicotak.com/avr/ledgame.html[LED Game for AVR].
Just copy `roll-ball/led.c` and `roll-ball/led.h` in 
http://www.callmeageek.com/filemgmt/visit.php?lid=1[my package]
to overwrite the same name files of other games.
