uIP-AVR v0.6 test on a ATmega88 and ENC28J60.

1) Hardware
I bought a SPI Ethernet Kit(based on enc28j60 ethernet chip) from IT-plaza, 
Akihabara, Tokyo.(2300 Yen)

The IT-plaza have a website for technical support:
http://optimize.ath.cx/

In the uip06-test.tar.gz, You can find spi_ether.htm(Japanese manual for soldering 
and testing) and spi_ether.pdf(schematic for this board). You can also find
these files in the mentioned website.

If you can not read Japanese, since the schematic is offered, the circuit
is easy to build by yourself.

Once the SPI ethernet board is available, you can test uIP version 0.6
by this two-way connection:

ENC28J60 board <--> ATmega88(10MHz crystal, lfuse=0xef)
+3.3 <--> VTG(3.3V, from STK500)
GND <--> GND
SO <--> MISO
SI <--> MOSI
SCK <--> SCK
CS <--> /SS(PB2)

ENC28J60 board <--> PC
RJ45 <--*CROSS* ETHERNET CABLE--> RJ45 of PC

2)Firmware of mega88 

2.1)In uipopt.h:
IP address was set to:
192.168.1.12
Mask was set to:
255.255.255.0

2.2)enc28j60.h, enc28j60.h from Pascal Stang's avrlib.

2.3)uIP v0.6:
uip.c uip.h
uipopt.h
uip_arp.h uip_arch.c
uip_arch.h uip_arch.c
main.c
compiler.h: capable of older avr-libc
VERSION.h

3) Setup IP address on Linux PC(Fedora Core 3)

Setup a new ethernet connection,
IP address was set to:
192.168.1.11
Mask was set to:
255.255.255.0
then activate this connection.

4)test
On your PC,
$telnet 192.168.1.12 80
