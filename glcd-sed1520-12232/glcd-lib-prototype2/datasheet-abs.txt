2.2 System Bus Interface Signals
• D7 – D0
8-bit, tri-state, bi-directional I/O bus. Normally,
connected to the data bus of an 8-/16-bit standard
microcomputer.
• A0
Input pin. Normally, the LSB of the MPU address
bus is connected to this input pin to
provide data/command selection.
0 : Display control data on D0 — D7
1 : Display data on D0 — D7
• RES
Input pin. The SED1520 can be reset or initialized
by setting RES to low level (if it is interfaced
with a 68-family MPU) or high level (if
with an 80-family MPU). This reset operation
occurs when an edge of the RES signal is
sensed. The level input selects the type of
interface with the 68- or 80-family MPU:
High level : Interface with 68-family MPU
Low level : Interface with 80-family MPU

S
Chip Select input signal which is normally
obtained by decoding an address bus signal.
Effective with “L” active and a chip operating
with external clocks. For a chip containing an
oscillator, CS works as an oscillation amplifier
input pin to which an oscillation resistor (Rf) is
connected. In this case, RD, WR and E must be
a signal ANDed with CS.
• E (RD)
• Chip interfaced with 68-family MPU:
Enable Clock signal input for the 68-
family MPU.
• Chip interfaced with 80-family MPU:
“L” active input pin to which the 80-family
MPU RD signal is connected. With this
signal held at “L”, the SED1520 data bus
works as output.
• R/W (WR)
• Chip interface with 68-family MPU:
Read/write control signal input pin.
R/W = “H” : Read
R/W = “L” : Write
• Chip interfaced with 80-family MPU:
“L” active input pin to which the 80-family
WR is connected. The signal on the data
bus is fetched by the leading edge of WR.

It seems 68 series is better.
