Please Read This Note First!

* The file 'README' in this folder is the author's original note.

* THIS DEMO PROGRAM IS BASED ON uC/OS-II VERSION 2.52

Tested on atmega128@16MHz(crystal).

hardware connection:

atmega128 <--> ft232bm :
RXD0(PE0) <--> TXD(pin25)
TXD0(PE1) <--> RXD(pin24)
if atmega128 board is powered by its own,
due to unknow reasons, the Vout of 7805 is
only 4.5V, so the GND pins must be connected
like this:
GND(mega128 board) <--> GND (232bm board)

power supply:
megat128 board:
VTG <-- STK500(5.0v)
GND <-- STK500
or 
powered by its own. 
(DC6.1Vin--7805-->DC4.5Vout--C117T-->DC3.3Vout)

ft232bm board:
VTG <-- usb bus(5v)
GND <-- usb

note:
1)set efuse from 0xFD(default, mega103 compatible mode) to 0xFF.
2)since F_CPU is 16M, in order to set uart baud rate 9600bps,
UBRR0L should be set to 103.
3)set lfuse from 0xe1 to 0xef.
